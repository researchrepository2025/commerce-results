# Silent Generation - Agentic Commerce Market Research Brief

## Research Assignment
**Generation**: Silent Generation (Born 1928-1945, Ages 80+ in 2025)  
**Research Focus**: US Consumer Agentic Commerce Adoption 2025-2030  
**Key Characteristic**: Limited but growing digital engagement, often caregiver-assisted

## Executive Summary

You are tasked with researching the Silent Generation's adoption potential for agentic commerce (AI agents making purchases autonomously). While this generation has the lowest direct technology adoption rates, they represent a unique opportunity through caregiver-mediated commerce and accessibility-driven solutions. Their adoption will primarily occur through family assistance, healthcare needs, and simplified interfaces designed for accessibility. Despite smaller population size, their concentrated wealth and essential spending create meaningful market opportunity.

## Market Sizing Formula

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) = Population × Adoption Rate × Usage Rate × Average Annual Spend**

Your research will provide the data inputs for this calculation for the Silent Generation specifically.

## Critical Data Requirements

### ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT
**WARNING**: Accuracy is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect of this research. Every single data point must be:
- Verified from legitimate sources
- Accompanied by a working URL
- Cross-referenced with multiple sources
