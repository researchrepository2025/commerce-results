## Research Assignment
**Generation**: Baby Boomers (Born 1946-1964, Ages 61-79 in 2025)  
**Research Focus**: US Consumer Agentic Commerce Adoption 2025-2030  
**Key Characteristic**: Wealthy retirees embracing digital convenience

## Executive Summary

You are tasked with researching Baby Boomers' adoption potential for agentic commerce (AI agents making purchases autonomously). This generation controls the largest share of US wealth and is increasingly embracing digital tools for convenience and accessibility. Their growing comfort with telehealth, online shopping, and voice assistants, combined with desires for simplified experiences and aging-in-place solutions, creates unexpected opportunity for agentic commerce adoption.

## Market Sizing Formula

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) = Population × Adoption Rate × Usage Rate × Average Annual Spend**

Your research will provide the data inputs for this calculation for Baby Boomers specifically.

## Critical Data Requirements

### ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT
**WARNING**: Accuracy is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect of this research. Every single data point must be:
- Verified from legitimate sources
- Accompanied by a working URL
