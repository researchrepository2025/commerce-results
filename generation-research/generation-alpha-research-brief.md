# Generation Alpha - Agentic Commerce Market Research Brief

## Research Assignment
**Generation**: Alpha (Born 2010-2024, Ages 1-15 in 2025)  
**Research Focus**: US Consumer Agentic Commerce Adoption 2025-2030  
**Shopping Eligible Population**: Ages 13-15 only

## Executive Summary

You are tasked with researching Generation Alpha's potential adoption of agentic commerce (AI agents making purchases on behalf of consumers). This generation, while young, represents future early adopters whose current technology habits will shape tomorrow's commerce landscape. Focus on the 13-15 age group who can participate in online shopping with parental oversight.

## Market Sizing Formula

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) = Population × Adoption Rate × Usage Rate × Average Annual Spend**

Your research will provide the data inputs for this calculation for Generation Alpha specifically.

## Critical Data Requirements

### ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT

### Year-by-Year Projections

Based on your research, calculate:

**2025 Baseline**: ____% 
- Calculation: (___% × 0.4) + (___% × 0.3) + (___% × 0.2) + (___% × 0.1) = ____%

**2026**: ____% (Growth rate: +___% from 2025)
