## CONCLUSION

The data suggests significantly more conservative AI agent purchase adoption than initially projected. While many consumers use AI daily, only a small fraction (0.2%-3.0% in 2025) of actual purchases will go through AI agents initially. Growth will be steady but measured, reaching 3%-27% by 2030 depending on generation, with younger generations leading adoption primarily in digital services, subscriptions, and routine purchases.
