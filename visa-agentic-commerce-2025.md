# Visa Agentic Commerce 2025

**Summary**: Visa has positioned itself at the forefront of agentic commerce through its Intelligent Commerce Platform (launched April 2025), which enables autonomous AI-to-AI transactions backed by tokenized credentials protecting nearly 50% of digital transactions. With $3.3B invested in AI infrastructure over the past decade, strategic partnerships with major AI platforms (Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI), and the $925M Featurespace acquisition, Visa leverages its massive scale (4.8B credentials, 150M merchants) to monetize through traditional transaction fees while focusing on volume growth from AI adoption, having already blocked $40B in fraud using AI in 2024.
