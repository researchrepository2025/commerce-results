# Current Regulatory Landscape for AI Agents in Commerce

## Executive Summary

The regulatory landscape for AI agents in commerce is rapidly evolving, with significant developments occurring across major jurisdictions in 2024-2025. The most notable recent change was the rescission of Executive Order 14110 on January 20, 2025, fundamentally altering the U.S. federal approach to AI regulation. Meanwhile, the EU AI Act has entered into force with prohibited practices now enforceable, state-level legislation continues to expand, and sector-specific regulations are being actively enforced.

## Conclusion

The regulatory landscape for AI agents in commerce is characterized by rapid evolution, jurisdictional fragmentation, and increasing enforcement activity. The rescission of Executive Order 14110 has shifted U.S. federal policy toward deregulation, while state-level legislation continues to expand and the EU AI Act enters active enforcement. Organizations deploying AI agents in commerce face a complex compliance matrix requiring careful legal analysis, robust risk management systems, and ongoing regulatory monitoring across multiple jurisdictions.

The trend toward private enforcement rights, substantial penalty structures, and sector-specific requirements suggests that compliance costs will continue to increase. Early adoption of comprehensive compliance frameworks, proactive regulatory engagement, and consultation with qualified legal counsel are essential for organizations operating AI agents in commercial applications.
