# Regulatory Evolution and Future Requirements for Agentic Commerce

## Executive Summary

The regulatory landscape for agentic commerce is rapidly evolving across federal agencies, state governments, and international bodies. This investigation reveals a complex patchwork of emerging requirements that will significantly impact autonomous AI agents performing commercial activities. Key findings include potential compliance costs ranging from $4-210 billion for major regulatory frameworks, active enforcement campaigns against AI washing, and coordinated international harmonization efforts through the G7 Hiroshima AI Process and OECD frameworks.
