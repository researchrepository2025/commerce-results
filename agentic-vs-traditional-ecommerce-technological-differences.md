## VERIFIED TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

### 1. DECISION-MAKING AND EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE

**Traditional eCommerce**: Static rule-based systems that execute predefined workflows based on conditional logic and user inputs. Systems respond to explicit user actions without autonomous decision-making capabilities.

**Agentic Commerce**: Autonomous software layers built on LLMs that can make decisions and execute actions independently.

**Verified Data Point**: "Agentic commerce refers to use cases in ecommerce for agentic AI. These AI agents are layers of software built on top of large language models (LLMs), designed not only to interact with humans through text-based, chatbot-style interfaces, but also to make decisions and execute actions autonomously."

### 4. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE PARADIGM

**Traditional eCommerce**: Monolithic or microservices architectures with predefined API interactions and fixed data flows.

**Agentic Commerce**: Fundamentally different software construction and world-interaction patterns enabling dynamic, context-aware operations.

**Verified Data Point**: "It's a tectonic change in a few dimensions... It upends the way software is built... changes how software interacts with the world."

---

## CONCLUSION

Despite extensive research across all approved providers, only 4 high-level technological differences between agentic and traditional eCommerce could be verified from 2025 sources. This suggests that:

1. Agentic commerce is still an emerging field with limited published technical documentation
2. Detailed technical specifications may be proprietary and not publicly available
3. The field is evolving too rapidly for comprehensive technical documentation to keep pace

The verified findings confirm that agentic commerce represents a fundamental shift in software architecture, decision-making capabilities, and human-computer interaction, but specific technical implementation details remain undocumented in publicly available 2025 sources from approved providers.
