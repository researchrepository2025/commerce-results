# Market Size Projections for Agentic Commerce Through 2030
## Deep Research Analysis Report

### Executive Summary

This comprehensive investigation into agentic commerce market projections through 2030 reveals significant growth potential but notable challenges in establishing definitive market size estimates. Based on analysis of projections from major research firms including McKinsey, Gartner, Forrester, BCG, and Deloitte, the research indicates that while the broader AI agents market is projected to reach $50-52 billion by 2030, specific "agentic commerce" market projections remain limited due to the emerging nature of this technology category.

**Key Finding**: No authoritative sources provide dedicated market size projections specifically for "agentic commerce" as defined in this research (autonomous AI agents performing commercial activities). Instead, projections exist for the broader AI agents market, which encompasses commerce applications alongside other use cases.
