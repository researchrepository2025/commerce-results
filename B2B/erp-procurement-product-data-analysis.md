## Conclusion

ERP/procurement systems are rapidly evolving from keyword-based catalog searches to AI-powered natural language interfaces. By Q3 2025, most major vendors will offer conversational search capabilities, though these will initially complement rather than replace traditional interfaces. The $2.26 billion market opportunity by 2032 indicates strong investment will continue in AI-enhanced procurement search and product data management.

Key challenges remain in data quality (12% revenue impact from bad product data), integration complexity between AI capabilities and existing procurement workflows, and the fundamental gap between open web research capabilities (ChatGPT/Perplexity) and closed catalog systems (ERP/Procurement). Success will require addressing both technical capabilities and the human change management needed for adoption.
