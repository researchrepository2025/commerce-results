## Question 1: Main Enterprise Journeys for B2B Agentic Commerce

### What We Know (Evidence-Based) - HIGH CONFIDENCE

**Note**: Updated pathway structure consolidates external AI tools for clarity. The key differentiators are: (1) Where does AI research happen? (2) Where does purchasing happen? (3) How integrated are the systems?

#### Three Primary Journey Pathways Identified
