Procurement Systems

SAP Ariba (SAP)

Product & AI Integration: SAP has embedded generative AI into its Ariba procurement suite. For example, the new SAP Ariba Category Management solution is being enhanced with generative AI to help procurement teams quickly draft data-driven category strategies ￼. SAP also unveiled Joule, a generative AI copilot, which will be embedded throughout SAP spend management applications in 2024 ￼. New AI features include an SAP Spend Control Tower for real-time spend analysis and AI-infused supplier risk assessments in sourcing, contracts, and buying modules ￼ ￼.

Partnerships: SAP is collaborating with partners to augment procurement. Notably, SAP is integrating an AI-powered supplier discovery tool from Scoutbee into Ariba Sourcing. This will autonomously find suppliers meeting complex criteria (capacity, quality, certifications) and feed them into Ariba’s guided sourcing events ￼. SAP demonstrated generative AI use cases with Google Cloud at events, reflecting partnerships on AI infrastructure, and SAP’s broader AI ecosystem includes ties with Microsoft, Google, and IBM for cloud AI services ￼.

Future & Ecosystem: SAP frames these innovations as steps toward “agentic” or autonomous procurement. Joule is slated to deliver proactive, conversational assistance across procurement and supply chain processes (e.g. analyzing sales vs. supply data to suggest fixes) ￼. General availability for key features was planned by end of 2023 (for category management AI) and into 2024 for wider Joule integration ￼. SAP’s approach emphasizes responsible AI (security, compliance, etc.) while leveraging its SAP Business Network ecosystem of buyers and suppliers ￼. Overall, SAP sees generative AI as transformative for spend management – speeding up decisions, mitigating risks, and enabling more autonomous B2B commerce.

Oracle Procurement Cloud (Oracle Fusion Applications)

Product & AI Integration: Oracle has added generative AI within its Fusion Cloud Procurement module as part of a broad March 2024 update to Oracle Fusion Applications. New AI features assist procurement professionals by recommending suppliers and auto-generating negotiation summaries. For instance, the system can suggest suitable suppliers for a purchase (using product descriptions and categories) to improve sourcing efficiency and reduce cost and risk ￼. It also uses AI to draft customized negotiation cover-page summaries, accelerating the creation of RFx documents and contract cover letters ￼. These capabilities are embedded directly into procurement workflows. Oracle reports more than 50 such AI use cases across its ERP, SCM, HR, and CX apps suite ￼.

Technology & Partnerships: Oracle’s generative AI is delivered through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle emphasizes data security – no customer data is shared with LLM providers when using its AI features, and customers can even choose their preferred large language model for certain use cases ￼. Oracle has invested in its own AI models and also partnered with leading model providers (e.g. Cohere) to host models on OCI ￼. This means Oracle customers get GenAI benefits (like GPT-powered insights) inside Fusion Procurement while keeping enterprise data private ￼.

Future & Ecosystem: Oracle is continuously embedding AI “copilots” across its Fusion Cloud ERP/SCM suites. The goal is to streamline B2B operations – from finance (AI-generated variance analyses) to procurement – by automating tedious tasks and augmenting decision-making ￼ ￼. Oracle’s vision of agentic commerce is one of AI-assisted workflows rather than fully autonomous agents: the system provides recommendations and draft outputs that human users review. In the procurement domain specifically, Oracle’s AI additions in 2024 (supplier suggestions, automated negotiation docs) highlight the growing autonomy in B2B purchasing processes ￼ ￼. Oracle’s broader cloud AI ecosystem and recent alliance with Microsoft (to interconnect OCI with Azure) further indicate a push to integrate AI while fitting into customers’ existing enterprise stacks.

Coupa (Business Spend Management)

Product & AI Integration: Coupa has aggressively embraced agentic AI to realize its vision of autonomous B2B spending. In late 2024, Coupa introduced “Coupa Navi”, a GenAI-based personal procurement assistant (copilot) that helps users navigate the Coupa platform. Coupa Navi can instantly find statuses, accelerate approvals and act as an always-available knowledge base, significantly boosting productivity ￼. By mid-2025, Coupa expanded this into a multi-agent AI portfolio as part of its “Navi” family ￼. New agents include: a Navi Analytics Agent to answer data queries with charts, a Navi Knowledge Agent to instantly provide policy answers, and even a “Bring Your Own AI” Agent that lets customers plug in external AI assistants for agent-to-agent collaboration ￼. Coupa also rolled out domain-specific agents like a Supply Chain “Modeling” Agent to tackle complex supply chain scenarios with advanced reasoning ￼.

Vision & Partnerships: Coupa markets itself as “AI-native” and highlights its unmatched $8 trillion in spend data to fuel these AI agents ￼. Its Coupa Navi agents operate within Coupa’s platform, but Coupa is also enabling an AI Agent Ecosystem – via the bring-your-own-agent capability and partnerships on its App Marketplace – so customers and partners can develop custom agentic experiences ￼. This openness indicates Coupa’s strategy to be the hub of a broad ecosystem of purchasing agents. Notably, Coupa stresses that these AI agents work in real time to autonomously match buyer needs with suppliers, heralding a shift from static apps to AI-guided networks that can act independently in B2B commerce ￼.

Future Outlook: Coupa’s roadmap explicitly aims for “autonomous spend management.” Executives describe multi-agent AI eventually handling end-to-end procurement tasks with minimal human intervention ￼. Already, early adopters report Navi agents pinpointing operational issues and suggesting fixes proactively ￼. Coupa’s May 2025 announcement positioned these AI advancements as “powering the future of global trade” ￼. In summary, Coupa sees agentic AI as the key to faster decisions, guided buying, and automated procurement – and is moving quickly with new AI features in its spend management ecosystem to get there.

GEP (GEP SMART)

Product & AI Integration: GEP has introduced an AI-driven “Total Orchestration” solution for procurement, unveiled in May 2024 ￼. This platform acts as an intelligent co-pilot embedded across GEP’s source-to-pay software, designed to simplify and automate procurement workflows end-to-end. GEP’s orchestration engine uses generative AI (via GEP’s own Quantum AI platform) and low-code tools to understand user requests and guide them through optimal buying processes ￼. For example, a casual business user can simply type a request into a search bar, and the system’s co-pilot will guide them to the right purchasing channel or create a sourcing event, eliminating dozens of manual steps ￼. The AI also provides supplier recommendations that factor in not just price but criteria like sustainability, risk, and diversity to suggest the best vendors ￼. Additionally, the platform supports natural-language analytics (users can ask questions and get on-the-fly spend dashboards) and can automate contract management tasks (auto-fulfilling certain steps based on invoice payments or other triggers) ￼.

User Focus & Ecosystem: GEP specifically built these capabilities to serve the growing base of non-procurement professionals who initiate purchase requests. They noted that in a few years, over 80% of procurement transactions will be done by business users outside the procurement department ￼. Thus, the Total Orchestration co-pilot offers a conversational, guided intake experience so that any employee can get what they need without deep process knowledge ￼. This human-centric design – with AI invisibly coordinating the complex workflow behind a simple chat interface – aims to boost adoption and compliance. GEP’s platform also acts as a “command center” that integrates with other enterprise systems and data sources, orchestrating across a multi-enterprise network for procurement and supply chain ￼.

Future & Market Impact: GEP’s approach to agentic procurement is about workflow orchestration rather than stand-alone bots. The co-pilot concept is woven through the entire GEP SMART suite, meaning AI can handle multi-step processes (from requisition through payment) with minimal friction. By partnering with the broader ecosystem (the solution integrates external data and can tie into other applications), GEP is positioning its platform as a central intelligent layer for spend management. The introduction of this AI co-pilot has been characterized as a significant innovation in the procurement software market, aimed at dramatically improving collaboration, visibility, and decision-making for enterprises ￼ ￼. Going forward, GEP is likely to expand on these AI features, using feedback from early deployments to broaden the co-pilot’s autonomous capabilities in sourcing and supply chain execution.

Jaggaer

Product & AI Integration: Jaggaer announced “JAGGAER JAI” in June 2025, an AI copilot that the company frames as a key step toward autonomous commerce in procurement ￼ ￼. JAI (pronounced “Jay”) is an embedded conversational AI assistant powered by large language models, integrated into the Jaggaer One platform ￼. Initially, JAI functions in a “human-guided” copilot mode: it can answer procurement questions, help navigate the system, draft documents (like RFQs or contract summaries), flag anomalies (e.g. PO or invoice discrepancies), and even initiate routine tasks on command ￼ ￼. For instance, a user can ask JAI to create an RFP or evaluate suppliers, and the AI will execute those steps while the user oversees. Jaggaer has already made JAI Assist available – a chatbot that provides contextual Q&A and guidance within procurement processes to streamline workflows ￼.

Roadmap (Assistant → Copilot → Autopilot): Jaggaer’s vision is explicitly laid out in stages. Later in 2025, JAI Copilot is planned to offer more advanced support: it will proactively identify outliers (like unusual spend patterns or supplier issues) and suggest remedial actions across sourcing, contracting, and supplier management, effectively saving procurement teams hours of analysis ￼. Beyond that, the ultimate goal is JAI Autopilot – a no-code/low-code agentic platform that can autonomously execute complex procurement workflows with minimal human input ￼ ￼. In Autopilot mode, JAI would coordinate multiple domain-specific agents (for sourcing, contracting, etc.), managing end-to-end processes (like an entire RFx cycle or order fulfillment) while humans act as high-level overseers ￼. This phased approach (assistant → copilot → autopilot) shows Jaggaer’s pragmatic rollout of autonomy, ensuring user trust via a “human in the loop” for now, but iterating toward greater independence.

Market & Partnerships: Jaggaer frequently highlights “Autonomous Commerce” as its guiding vision – meaning a B2B commerce environment where AI agents transact, negotiate, and make decisions on behalf of humans. JAI is a core pillar of this strategy. While Jaggaer hasn’t publicly named specific LLM partners in its announcement, it indicated JAI is leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs under the hood ￼. Jaggaer is likely using partnerships (with cloud AI providers or NLP firms) to deliver JAI’s capabilities; indeed, the company has mentioned working with tech partners in past AI endeavors. In the wider ecosystem, Jaggaer’s move pushes competitive pressure on other procurement suites to offer similar AI copilots. By integrating JAI into all Jaggaer One modules (sourcing, P2P, supplier management, etc.), the company is aiming to provide a frictionless, intelligence-driven procurement experience. Early customer feedback from Jaggaer’s REV 2025 event was positive, with an emphasis on JAI’s potential to orchestrate agents across the supply chain and radically improve efficiency ￼ ￼.

ERP Systems

Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP

Product & AI Integration: Oracle has infused generative AI across its Fusion Cloud ERP and related enterprise apps. Announced at CloudWorld 2024, over 50 new GenAI features span finance, supply chain, HR, and more ￼ ￼. In the ERP/finance realm, Oracle introduced AI-generated “Insight Narratives” and management report write-ups – the system uses pattern recognition to explain variances or anomalies in plain language for quicker decision-making ￼ ￼. Predictive forecasts in ERP now come with AI-produced explanations to build trust in the numbers ￼. For project management, AI can draft status summaries and even project plans based on past similar projects ￼.

In the supply chain and procurement areas (part of the ERP suite), Oracle’s GenAI can suggest new suppliers based on purchase context and item data, which helps procurement teams expand or optimize their supplier base automatically ￼. It also can generate negotiation summaries – basically composing the cover pages and key points for procurement contracts or RFQs – accelerating the preparation of negotiation documents ￼. All these AI features are embedded directly into Oracle’s Fusion ERP workflows, appearing as proactive recommendations or auto-generated content within the user’s normal screens.

Technology & Data Security: Oracle’s approach is to leverage its own cloud AI stack (OCI). The generative AI models (from Oracle or third parties) are hosted on OCI, and Oracle stresses that enterprise data stays isolated – “no customer data is shared with LLM providers or other customers” ￼. Oracle even built an extensible “Oracle Guided Journeys” framework that lets customers plug in their preferred large language model if desired, to tailor AI behaviors to their industry needs ￼ ￼. Under the hood, Oracle has partnered with AI model companies like Cohere and others, optimizing OCI’s infrastructure (with high-performance GPUs and networking) to train and serve models efficiently ￼. This gives Oracle a vertically integrated control over the AI – unlike some rivals who rely on external AI APIs – and appeals to customers concerned about data privacy.

Future & Ecosystem: Oracle’s leadership (CTO Larry Ellison, et al.) has positioned these AI features as productivity boosters that “help customers improve decision making and reduce the cost of doing business” ￼ ￼. In practical terms, Oracle Fusion ERP is moving toward an AI-augmented finance and operations platform – where routine analysis, data entry, and even some tactical decisions (like supplier selection) are handled by AI. The expectation is that over time, Oracle will expand from assisted decisions (copilot suggestions) to more autonomous transaction processing in areas like invoice matching, exception handling, and procurement ops. Oracle is also melding this AI push with its broader ecosystem: for example, Oracle’s partnership with Microsoft allows Azure OpenAI services to connect with Oracle data (announced in 2023), and Oracle’s applications could benefit from that interoperability. Overall, Oracle Fusion ERP’s recent AI announcements solidify it as a major player in bringing agentic AI to enterprise resource planning, with an emphasis on trusted AI (secure, enterprise-grade) and seamless integration into existing business processes ￼ ￼.

Oracle NetSuite ERP

Product & AI Integration: Oracle’s NetSuite (the SMB/mid-market cloud ERP) has similarly rolled out generative AI and agent features in the past year. At SuiteWorld 2023 (Oct 2023), NetSuite introduced “Text Enhance” – a generative AI capability embedded across the suite to create and refine content in context ￼ ￼. This allows, for example, automatically generating contextual text for finance and operations: collections emails, job descriptions, marketing copy, or even purchasing and logistics communications can be drafted by AI based on company-specific data ￼ ￼. By early 2025, NetSuite expanded on this with new AI Agents integrated into its platform ￼. One is the NetSuite CPQ AI Assistant, which supports B2B sales configuration – it chats with sales reps or customers to suggest optimal product configurations in a natural language dialog and then explains why those options were recommended ￼ ￼. This essentially acts as a sales configurator agent, speeding up complex B2B orders. Another is NetSuite Expert for SuiteAnswers, an AI support agent that can answer user questions about how to use NetSuite by drawing on NetSuite’s knowledge base and support articles ￼. Users can ask a how-to question in plain English, and the agent will instantly deliver a specific answer or troubleshooting steps, rather than users manually searching docs ￼.

Platform & Privacy: These NetSuite AI features are built on Oracle’s GenAI services (OCI). NetSuite emphasizes a “secure by design” approach similar to Fusion: customer data and prompts stay within NetSuite’s environment. In fact, NetSuite touted that no data from your ERP goes to external AI providers and that role-based access is enforced on AI outputs ￼ ￼. This was positioned as a competitive differentiator, hinting that some businesses fear using third-party AI if it means sending sensitive data outside. NetSuite’s AI also leverages Oracle’s AI infrastructure – for example, Oracle’s OCI Generative AI was mentioned as supporting these features, and Oracle’s partnership with Cohere/Anthropic likely benefits NetSuite too. For administrators and developers, NetSuite added a Prompt Management API to centrally manage the prompts and LLM interactions for custom use cases, which signals a maturing platform for AI extensibility ￼.

Future & Ecosystem: Oracle NetSuite’s leadership indicated that these AI capabilities (Text Enhance, CPQ assistant, etc.) are provided at no extra cost to customers ￼ – suggesting Oracle is all-in on driving AI adoption to maintain its ERP market edge. We can expect NetSuite to continue adding domain-specific agents (perhaps an AP invoice processing agent, or planning/budgeting assistant) given the trajectory. The overall market ecosystem for mid-market ERP is now seeing AI as a must-have: competitors like Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, or Acumatica, are also dabbling in AI. NetSuite’s announcements show it wants to stay ahead by offering a comprehensive AI-assisted ERP out-of-the-box. Additionally, Oracle is leveraging NetSuite’s strong channel and partner network – for instance, SuiteCloud developers can integrate generative AI into their apps via new APIs ￼, meaning an ecosystem of partner solutions with AI may grow around NetSuite. All told, NetSuite’s agentic commerce strategy is about making ERP functions (from data entry to sales ordering to support) more autonomous, while keeping the human in control of final decisions. Early use cases (like AI-generated field entries to reduce data entry errors, or AI answering support questions) are incremental improvements, but they lay the groundwork for more complex autonomous behaviors in the future.

SAP S/4HANA (SAP ERP)

Product & AI Integration: SAP’s flagship ERP, S/4HANA, is being enhanced with SAP’s generative AI assistant Joule (as part of the SAP Business AI portfolio). Announced in Sept 2023, SAP Joule is a natural-language copilot that will be embedded across SAP’s cloud applications, including S/4HANA finance, supply chain, procurement, HR, and more ￼. Joule is designed to proactively sift through the vast enterprise data in SAP systems (and even relevant third-party data) and surface contextualized insights or perform actions in response to plain-language questions ￼ ￼. For example, a user could ask, “Why are Q3 sales down in region X?” and Joule might identify an underlying supply chain disruption and automatically pull up a proposed solution (like re-routing a supply source) by cross-referencing S/4HANA sales data and procurement data ￼. In procurement, SAP demonstrated that Joule could help write unbiased job descriptions (HR use case) or analyze supplier performance and risks, indicating broad applicability across use cases ￼. Essentially, Joule turns the ERP into a conversational system – “it’s like tapping your smartest colleague on the shoulder,” as SAP’s CEO Christian Klein put it ￼.

Partnerships & AI Ecosystem: SAP has taken a multi-pronged approach to AI for S/4HANA. They have partnered with major AI players – in mid-2023 SAP announced collaborations with Microsoft (Azure OpenAI services), Google Cloud (generative AI infrastructure), and IBM, among others ￼. SAP also made direct investments in AI companies (e.g. Anthropic, Cohere, Aleph Alpha) to ensure they have access to cutting-edge LLM technology ￼. Notably, SAP and Microsoft have a cloud partnership which includes making SAP data available to Microsoft 365 Copilot, and vice versa, Microsoft’s AI integrations with SAP. SAP’s strategy is to offer choice of foundational models under the hood of Joule – leveraging the best available AI while keeping the experience native in SAP applications. This robust ecosystem approach means S/4HANA’s AI can improve continuously and use specialized models for tasks like document processing or translation when needed. SAP also has emphasized building guardrails into Joule (given enterprise requirements for data privacy and AI ethics) ￼. Joule’s responses are grounded in the customer’s actual business data (as opposed to generic internet data), which SAP believes will yield more trustworthy and relevant output.

Future & Impact: Joule was scheduled to first roll out in SAP SuccessFactors (HR) and the SAP Start portal in late 2023, followed by SAP S/4HANA Cloud (public edition) in early 2024 ￼. Throughout 2024, SAP planned to announce many Joule-driven scenarios for other modules – at events like SAP Spend Connect (for procurement) and SAP Customer Experience Live ￼. This cadence suggests that by now (late 2025), S/4HANA customers have begun experiencing Joule in areas like financial closing, forecasting, or procurement analytics (for example, automated spend summaries or payment block explanations generated by AI). SAP’s overall message is that generative AI will be part of the fabric of everyday work in ERP ￼. In the market, this positions SAP strongly against competitors: by infusing AI at the platform level, SAP can claim a unified “brain” across ERP, SCM, CRM, etc. The concept of agentic commerce for SAP translates to things like automated insights and actions in S/4HANA (rather than independent purchase agents as some others envision). Still, these are significant steps toward autonomy – e.g., a future Joule could potentially execute transactions (with approval) such as reordering stock or reassigning production schedules when it detects issues. In summary, SAP S/4HANA’s last 12 months of announcements show a commitment to AI-driven ERP, with Joule bringing conversational AI and intelligent automation deeply into the core of business processes ￼ ￼.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 (ERP & Supply Chain)

Product & AI Integration: Microsoft made waves by launching Dynamics 365 Copilot (billed as “the first AI Copilot in both CRM and ERP”) in March 2023. Over the past year, these capabilities have been rolling out across Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, and other modules. In the context of procurement and supply chain (i.e., Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management), Microsoft introduced Copilot support for procurement to assist with the high volume of purchase order changes and supplier communications that buyers handle ￼ ￼. One prominent feature is an AI that automatically summarizes changes in confirmed purchase orders and assesses their downstream impact. Using an OpenAI GPT model (text-davinci-003), Copilot generates a natural-language summary of what changed – quantities, dates, etc. – and highlights any potential risks or production impacts from those changes ￼ ￼. This helps procurement managers quickly identify which PO modifications are low-impact (and can be approved routinely) versus high-impact changes that might disrupt manufacturing or customer orders ￼ ￼. The AI can even draft an email or Teams message to the supplier about the change, making the buyer’s job easier ￼.

Beyond purchase orders, Dynamics 365 Copilot in supply chain can monitor external events and supplier performance to proactively flag risks (for example, if a key supplier is in a region facing a hurricane, Copilot might suggest securing alternate supply). Microsoft has showcased Copilot writing draft supply chain reports, answering natural-language questions about inventory levels, and helping create product descriptions for e-commerce, all using generative AI. Another useful agentic feature in Dynamics 365 Finance is AI-generated explanations for variances or cash flow changes, similar to what Oracle and SAP are doing – indicating an industry-wide trend.

Partnerships & Tech: Microsoft’s generative AI in Dynamics 365 is powered by Azure OpenAI Service, meaning it leverages OpenAI’s GPT-4/3.5 models with enterprise controls. Microsoft has a unique advantage as an investor and partner of OpenAI – they deeply integrated these LLMs into the Microsoft Cloud. This includes Power Platform (for example, Power Automate can create workflows from natural language) and Microsoft 365 Copilot which connects to Business Central/Dynamics data. For Dynamics 365 specifically, Microsoft has built the Copilot experience into the UI – e.g., a sidebar chat or an “AI summary” button on certain forms. They also ensure compliance by grounding the AI on the customer’s data and using permission checks (Copilot will only include data the requesting user can access).

Microsoft is also extending this to Teams integration – procurement or sales folks can query ERP data via Teams Copilot chat. Notably, Microsoft announced in May 2023 an expanded partnership with SAP (so that SAP’s data can be accessed in Teams Copilot) ￼, which underscores how serious Microsoft is about positioning Teams as a front-end for agentic interactions with enterprise systems. In the case of its own Dynamics ERP, Microsoft can tightly couple these AI assistants with Office tools – for instance, a Copilot in Dynamics can draft a vendor follow-up email and open it directly in Outlook for the user to review.

Future & Market: Microsoft’s vision for agentic commerce in B2B is often phrased as “AI to remove drudgery”. They are not selling an autonomous agent to negotiate with suppliers (at least not yet); instead, they provide copilots to augment human decision-makers. Over the last year, Microsoft has rapidly updated these copilots: by late 2024, many Dynamics 365 modules had GA or preview Copilot features (e.g. Procurement Copilot for purchase order management was in preview by Aug 2023 ￼). Microsoft will likely continue adding scenarios – e.g. an “Inventory Optimization Copilot” or “Project Planning Copilot” – and eventually connect them. Given Microsoft’s broad AI push (with Copilots in Windows, Office, GitHub, etc.), we can expect its ERP Copilot to become more capable and perhaps more autonomous. In the competitive landscape, Microsoft is pushing the message that their AI can predict disruptions and suggest actions in supply chain better than niche players, due to Microsoft’s AI R&D strength ￼. If agentic commerce evolves towards fully autonomous agents transacting, Microsoft’s foundation with Copilot (and its responsible AI approach) might evolve into more autonomous behaviors, but currently Microsoft emphasizes human-in-the-loop productivity gains. Customers of Dynamics 365 are starting to see tangible benefits like faster response to supplier changes and simpler data analysis, thanks to these generative AI copilots ￼ ￼.

Workday

Product & AI Integration: Workday, known for HCM and financial management software, announced Workday Illuminate in September 2024 – its next-generation AI platform to underpin all Workday products ￼. Illuminate leverages Workday’s huge trove of HR and Finance data (800+ billion transactions) to provide context-aware AI across applications ￼. One visible outcome is the new Workday Assistant, a conversational AI helper embedded in the UI. Workday Assistant uses generative AI to let users ask questions or issue commands in natural language – for example, “show me our Q4 hiring budget variance” or “initiate a purchase requisition for a laptop” – and it will fetch data or kick off processes accordingly ￼ ￼. In Workday Procurement, Workday Assistant now provides a guided buying experience, wherein it can proactively recommend the correct purchasing process for an employee’s request (whether it should be an expense report, a PO, a contract, etc.), making the user journey much simpler ￼.

Workday is also rolling out specialized AI agents for specific finance functions. For example, a new Expenses Agent in Workday Financials automates much of expense report processing. It can automatically itemize hotel bills (using credit card and receipt data), group expenses into trips, and even notify users via Slack/Teams if their report needs corrections ￼ ￼. This agent essentially behaves like an autonomous accountant for expense reimbursements. Another area is Accounts Payable: Workday has partnered with a startup (Auditoria) to automate AP helpdesk queries with AI, and it’s added AI to prioritize AP work by supplier risk ￼.

Partnerships: Workday is augmenting its in-house AI with strategic partnerships. In mid-2024, Workday announced an expanded partnership with Google Cloud to use Google’s Vertex AI and upcoming Gemini large language models for its generative AI features ￼. This means Workday can build AI features (like those Workday Assistant skills) using Google’s advanced models while keeping control over enterprise data. Additionally, Workday has been working with AWS – Workday’s cloud runs on AWS, and earlier it used Amazon Lex for some chatbot capabilities. But with generative AI, the Google partnership stands out as bringing cutting-edge model capacity into Workday’s platform. Workday also opened an “AI Gateway”, which allows customers to plug in their own AI models or services into the Workday environment ￼. This flexibility, alongside an AI Marketplace (Workday’s Extend platform), means the Workday ecosystem could see partners offering pre-built AI solutions (for example, a supplier risk scoring agent or a workforce scheduling optimizer).

Future & Vision: Workday’s messaging is focused on a “human-centered approach to AI,” explicitly stating the goal is to augment employees, not replace them ￼. However, the capabilities they are developing do hint at increasing autonomy in routine tasks. Workday’s roadmap speaks of providing every user with a “team of process-specific agents” that can act on the user’s behalf across business processes ￼. In fact, Illuminate is said to enable AI orchestration of entire business processes, coordinating multiple agents to achieve an outcome for the user (all behind the scenes) ￼. For example, closing the books could involve an agent for reconciliation, another for variance analysis, and another for compiling the report – all orchestrated by Workday’s AI to work together and present the result to the user. This is the agentic commerce vision within Workday’s domain: swarms of narrow AI agents handling pieces of workflows like procurement, expenses, hiring, etc., guided by higher-level objectives.

In the market, Workday’s AI push comes as Oracle and SAP also integrate AI in ERP, but Workday can leverage its pure cloud, unified platform advantage. Already, Workday points out that 1,000+ customers are using its built-in AI in planning/budgeting ￼ ￼. Customer stories from Workday Rising 2024 indicated early wins (e.g. HPE using genAI to speed up financial planning). Workday likely will continue refining these agents and possibly release more (there was mention of four new AI agents coming, potentially for areas like talent, scheduling, and procurement). By harnessing the “world’s largest HR and finance dataset,” Workday hopes its AI will be more pre-trained on business context than generic AI, resulting in more relevant automation ￼ ￼. In summary, over the last year Workday has laid a foundation (Illuminate, Workday Assistant, key agents) for AI-powered ERP, with a collaborative approach (Google Cloud partnership) and a clear signal that autonomous finance and HR workflows are on the horizon – albeit always with a layer of human oversight promised.

Infor CloudSuite (Infor ERP)

Product & AI Integration: Infor, which specializes in industry-focused CloudSuite ERPs (for manufacturing, healthcare, etc.), has been quietly embedding AI as well. In 2024, Infor rebranded its “Coleman AI” capabilities simply as Infor AI and launched the Infor GenAI Platform leveraging AWS’s generative AI services ￼ ￼. Infor has a deep partnership with Amazon Web Services, and in late 2024 it announced it would use Amazon Bedrock (AWS’s platform for foundation models) to power new generative AI features in CloudSuite ￼ ￼. With this, Infor introduced several AI components:
	•	Infor GenAI Embedded Experiences: These are generative AI features built directly into CloudSuite applications’ UI. They enable things like assisted rich-text authoring, content summarization, and contextual comparisons within ERP workflows ￼. For example, a CloudSuite for procurement can now automatically generate a detailed product description or translate a spec sheet into another language for a supplier ￼. It can also summarize and compare vendor contracts or purchase agreements, helping users digest long documents quickly ￼. These GenAI features are tailored by industry – e.g. a fashion industry CloudSuite might help generate product names and descriptions with relevant adjectives, whereas an automotive CloudSuite might summarize engineering change orders.
	•	Infor GenAI Assistant: This is essentially an AI chatbot that provides a conversational interface across the ERP. It’s designed to handle multi-step tasks by orchestrating actions in multiple modules ￼ ￼. For instance, a user could ask, “Do we have any urgent orders awaiting approval?” and the GenAI Assistant will search across procurement and finance modules to find if there are POs pending approval; it can then present them and even take an action (like approving or routing them) as instructed. Because a complex process might involve different systems (inventory, purchasing, production), the assistant uses an internal orchestration mechanism: individual CloudSuite teams expose “tools” or APIs to the assistant, and the assistant’s AI decides which ones to invoke in sequence to fulfill the user’s intent ￼. Essentially, it’s an AI agent that knows how to navigate the entire ERP for the user – saving them from manually clicking through multiple applications to get a task done.
	•	Infor GenAI Knowledge Hub: This is an AI-driven knowledge search tool. It ingests documentation (product manuals, HR policies, support tickets, etc.) and uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to answer user questions in natural language ￼ ￼. So an employee could ask the Knowledge Hub “How do I submit a capital expenditure request in the system?” and the AI will draw from guides or wikis to give a step-by-step answer. It’s like a domain-specific ChatGPT for a company’s internal knowledge, with built-in security to ensure you only get answers from documents you have permission to view ￼ ￼.

Partnership (AWS) & Strategy: Infor’s choice to partner with AWS is notable – while others partner with OpenAI or Google, Infor is leveraging AWS’s broad selection of foundation models (via Bedrock, they can tap models from Anthropic, Cohere, Amazon’s own Titan, etc.). This allows Infor to offer multiple model options and pick the right model for the task (like a code-generation model for some developer assist features, vs. a text summarization model for contract analysis). It deepens Infor’s tie to AWS (Infor already hosts most CloudSuite deployments on AWS) ￼. The partnership also addresses data privacy: Infor can assure customers that data stays in the AWS secure environment, isolated per tenant, and that Bedrock’s managed models won’t leak their data – similar assurances that Oracle and SAP give. Infor has highlighted that it’s focusing GenAI on “solving industry-specific problems with domain knowledge”, which plays to Infor’s niche in verticals like fashion, aerospace, automotive, etc. ￼ ￼. They argue that generic AI is less useful unless tuned with industry data – and Infor has that data and process context from decades of specialized ERP solutions.

Future Outlook: With the Infor GenAI Platform now in place, Infor’s various CloudSuite product teams are empowered to rapidly deploy new AI-driven features without reinventing the wheel (thanks to common services for security, APIs, etc.) ￼. We’re likely to see a proliferation of micro-use-cases across Infor’s suites: e.g., an AI suggestion for optimal machine maintenance schedules in Infor’s EAM (asset management), or an AI that writes patient discharge instructions in Infor’s healthcare ERP, etc. The GenAI Assistant could evolve into a more autonomous agent; currently, it “retains context throughout multi-turn conversations” and can execute transactions on the user’s behalf within set limits ￼. Over time, as confidence grows, Infor might allow it to, say, automatically handle routine approvals or recommend inventory transfers when supply is low – basically an autonomous supply chain planner. Infor’s messaging around instant value with domain-specific AI suggests they see agentic AI as a way for their customers (often manufacturers or distributors) to get insights and automation without needing data scientists on staff.

In the competitive ecosystem, Infor is somewhat quieter about AI in media compared to SAP/Oracle, but these 2024 moves indicate they are ensuring parity. Infor’s focus on “business process optimization” and employee productivity via AI is similar to peers ￼. One differentiator could be if Infor’s industry-centric AI truly performs better on those specialized tasks than a one-size model used by others. For B2B purchasing specifically, Infor’s GenAI can summarize vendor contracts, compare terms, answer vendor performance questions, and even orchestrate purchase approvals via the Assistant ￼ ￼. That means Infor’s clients (often in manufacturing) can expect faster RFQ turnarounds and fewer manual steps in procurement. Going forward, we expect Infor to continue this AWS-aligned AI strategy, expanding the library of industry-tailored AI “skills” and possibly introducing more autonomous agents for routine transactions (with human oversight settings). In summary, Infor’s recent announcements show it bringing generative and agentic AI into the heart of CloudSuite ERP, focusing on practical use cases like content generation and cross-application orchestration to move towards an “intelligent ERP” era ￼ ￼.
