### Pathway Clarification: Why External AI Tools Are Grouped Together

The consolidation of external AI research tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot) into Pathway 1 reflects three key differentiating questions:

**"Where does the AI live?"**
- **Pathway 1**: AI lives outside the enterprise procurement system (ChatGPT, Perplexity, external Copilot)
- **Pathway 2**: AI is embedded within the enterprise procurement system (SAP Joule, Oracle AI, integrated Copilot)

**"How many systems do users touch?"**
- **Pathway 1**: Multiple systems - external AI tool for research, then procurement system for execution
- **Pathway 2**: Single system - all activities within the integrated ERP/procurement platform

**"Where is the purchase executed?"**
- **Pathway 1 & 2**: Within enterprise procurement systems with formal approval workflows
- **Pathway 3**: Directly on vendor platforms with optional procurement system integration

Enterprises commonly use multiple external AI tools interchangeably (ChatGPT for quick comparisons, Perplexity for research, Copilot for enterprise integration) but the fundamental workflow pattern remains consistent: external research → internal execution.

## Conclusion

The B2B customer journey for IT and AI hardware/software purchasing in 2025 represents a complex hybrid of traditional procurement processes and emerging AI-powered capabilities. While 94% of procurement executives use generative AI weekly, enterprise adoption remains constrained by security, compliance, and integration requirements.

The evidence indicates three primary pathway patterns, with external AI-assisted procurement showing rapid growth (73% adoption), traditional ERP-integrated systems maintaining enterprise dominance (70% of large enterprises), and direct marketplace purchasing expanding significantly (88% make purchases). The future evolution toward AI-first procurement models by 2027 will require significant investment in enterprise-grade integration, security frameworks, and regulatory compliance.

Success in this evolving landscape requires balancing AI innovation with enterprise governance requirements, maintaining the human elements that B2B buyers prefer, while building the technological capabilities to support autonomous procurement workflows in the medium term.
