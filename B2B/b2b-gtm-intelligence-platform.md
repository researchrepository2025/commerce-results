## Tab 3: Friction Analysis - Buyer Pain Points & Winning Strategies


### Overview

This section analyzes buyer friction points across each journey phase and identifies winning GTM strategies to address them.


### Awareness / Research Phase


**Critical Friction Points:**

- [51%cite vendor sites as top source, but only9%consider them reliable](https://www.sellerscommerce.com/blog/b2b-marketing-statistics/) (Trust Paradox)

- [90%research 2-7 vendor sites before purchasing](https://www.sopro.io/resources/b2b-sales-statistics) — comparison shopping is the expected norm

- [Buyers cannot compare products across vendor sites without extensive manual research and tab-switching](https://www.sopro.io/resources/b2b-sales-statistics)

- [No centralized source of truth — buyers must verify information across multiple third-party platforms](https://www.sellerscommerce.com/blog/b2b-marketing-statistics/)

- Vendor direct sites account for only [35%of transaction value vs65%through marketplaces](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-b2b-ecommerce-market)


**Winning Strategies:**

- [Third-party validation: Establish presence on analyst reports, review sites (G2, TrustRadius), marketplace reviews to combat trust gap](https://www.sellerscommerce.com/blog/b2b-marketing-statistics/)

- [Consistent cross-platform presence: Align messaging across vendor site, marketplaces, and review platforms for credibility](https://www.sellerscommerce.com/blog/b2b-marketing-statistics/)

- [AI-optimized content: Structure product data for ChatGPT/Perplexity discovery (94%of procurement execs use GenAI weekly)](https://artofprocurement.com/blog/state-of-ai-in-procurement)

- [Marketplace presence: Amazon Business ($35B+ GMV) provides instant credibility and multi-vendor comparison capability](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/10/29/amazon-business-still-dominates-b2b-marketplace/)

- [Self-service portals: HP2B integration with Ariba/Oracle/SAP (13 languages, 43 currencies, 200+ countries)](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/cv/hp2b)


**💡 Key Insight: The Trust Paradox**

[Buyers cite vendor websites as their #1 information source yet only 9% consider them reliable](https://www.sellerscommerce.com/blog/b2b-marketing-statistics/). This creates a critical opportunity gap: buyers want direct vendor information but need third-party validation. Winners invest in both owned channels AND third-party credibility signals.


### Evaluation Phase


**Critical Friction Points:**

- [92%of B2B leaders have ecommerce frustrations](https://www.sana-commerce.com/blog/b2b-ecommerce-trends-2025/) during evaluation phase

- [90%expect B2C-like experience](https://www.sopro.io/resources/b2b-sales-statistics) (currently not delivered by most B2B platforms)

- [77%describe purchasing decisions as highly complex or difficult](https://www.sopro.io/resources/b2b-sales-statistics)

- [75%must go through formal RFP process with average37-dayevaluation period](https://www.technologyadvice.com/blog/sales/b2b-buyer-statistics/)

- [78%shortlist only 3 vendors for deep evaluation](https://www.technologyadvice.com/blog/sales/b2b-buyer-statistics/) — early positioning is critical

- Only [36%achieve meaningful AI implementations vs73%still in experimentation phase](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/how-gen-ai-can-unlock-procurement-superpowers)


**Winning Strategies:**

- Visual configurators: [Market growing from$1.2B (2024) → $4.8B (2033)at 14.8% CAGR](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/product-configurator-software-market-12345) — essential for complex B2B products

- [Advanced configuration tools: Dell EIPT (infrastructure planning)](https://www.dell.com/calc), [Cisco CCW (Build & Price)](https://blogs.cisco.com/partner/cisco-commerce-workspace-adoption-ciscos-commitment-to-ease-of-doing-business-five-best-practices-for-driving-system-transformation), [HP iQuote (intelligent compatibility validation)](https://www.quotewerks.com/QuoteImporter.asp)

- [AI-powered recommendations:10-15%sales increases,10-20%satisfaction improvements](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/next-in-personalization-2021-report)

- [TCO/ROI calculators: Embedded in evaluation tools (Cisco, Dell) to quantify business value](https://www.dell.com/calc)

- [RFP automation with weighted scoring:15-30%efficiency gains via ERP integration](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/how-gen-ai-can-unlock-procurement-superpowers)

- [Self-service portals: Drive15-30%revenue increases from current accounts](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/b2b-digital-commerce-is-here-to-stay)

**💡 Key Insight: The Pre-Selection Bias**

[92%start with at least one vendor in mind](https://www.technologyadvice.com/blog/sales/b2b-buyer-statistics/); [41%have a preferred vendor before formal evaluation begins](https://www.cognism.com/blog/b2b-buying-statistics). The evaluation phase isn't about getting into consideration — it's about staying there. [71%chose their first-choice product](https://www.cognism.com/blog/b2b-buying-statistics), meaning awareness-stage positioning determines evaluation outcomes.

[95%of buyers believe self-service improves efficiency](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/b2b-digital-commerce-is-here-to-stay), but [33%order errors prevent adoption](https://www.sana-commerce.com/blog/b2b-ecommerce-trends-2025/).
