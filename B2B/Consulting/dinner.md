# AI in the Enterprise: Insights from a Cross-Industry Dinner

Last night's dinner brought together business leaders from financial services, healthcare, the UN, and other sectors to discuss the realities of deploying AI in large organizations. What emerged was a surprisingly candid conversation about where companies are actually struggling.

## The Real Blocker Isn't Technology

The most striking consensus: **first-order problems are human, second-order problems are technical.**

A CEO issues the mandate: "Go do AI." The pressure is intense—fall behind and you're 14 months behind competitors. But the work lands on middle managers who must build and deploy these solutions, and many are skeptical or resistant. They're overwhelmed with potential use cases and no clear framework for prioritizing them.

## The ROI Problem Nobody Has Solved

Perhaps the most uncomfortable truth: **nobody has figured out ROI calculations.**

Productivity tools add up fast: $20/month here, $20/month there—suddenly $50/month per employee. At 10,000 employees that's $6M annually. But can you prove the productivity gain? Multiple participants admitted they're not seeing expected returns.

Or consider reducing IT outage time—valuable, yes, but translating that into dollars requires so many assumptions that ROI becomes more art than science.

The result: **revenue-generating use cases (sales, customer service, marketing) win funding battles.** Efficiency plays like HR improvements wait in line.

## Build or Buy: The Two-Thirds Rule

Consensus emerged: roughly **two-thirds buy, one-third build**.

Buy when it's table stakes technology from multiple vendors and you lack differentiated data. Build when you have proprietary data creating competitive advantage or the capability is core to your mission.

Key insight: "The model doesn't matter as much as the data you put into it and how you integrate it into workflows."

## Workflows vs. Agents

There was moderate bullishness toward structured workflows over fully agentic systems, though the distinction may be somewhat artificial—you can give agents step-by-step instructions and they can still execute prescribed workflows.

## The 10-Year Talent Problem

Organizations are flattening and hiring fewer entry-level graduates. But then someone asked: "What happens in 10 years when experienced people retire and we haven't developed anyone new?"

This sparked debate about remote work. The dinner demographic skewed 50s+, and perspectives split generationally. Some argued in-person presence is essential for culture and learning. Others countered that the upcoming AI-native generation (5-10 years out) will work fundamentally differently with AI agents, making location less relevant.

One participant noted his software engineering student son uses AI completely differently than his generation—potentially making "teaching others how to use AI" a valuable role for new hires, though the ROI is fuzzy.

## Development Methodology Shift

Agreement that scrum-based development is declining for AI work, with companies returning to **pair programming approaches**.

## The Patchwork Future

In 2-3 years: **AI won't be uniformly deployed.** Expect pockets of heavy adoption where ROI is clear, while other departments remain unchanged because implementation costs can't be justified.

## Technical Challenges

Once human problems are solved, technical gaps remain: long-term memory and learning systems, getting differentiated data into usable formats (knowledge graphs, vector databases, hybrids), and a significant talent shortage. Skills needed resemble traditional software engineering more than data science.

## Security: Still Unresolved

When do you address security—at use case presentation or during development? No consensus emerged.

## The Global Divide

Over 2 billion people lack internet access and remain digitally illiterate. As AI advances, this geographically concentrated divide grows. No solutions discussed, just acknowledgment.

## The Central Tension

The dinner kept returning to one theme: **pressure to deploy AI quickly versus the messy reality of making it work.** Fear of falling behind competitors drives action, but ROI is unclear, managers are skeptical, security isn't figured out, talent is scarce, and productivity gains are uncertain.

## Key Insights & Learnings

### What Was Actually Discussed

**Business/Human Blockers (First-Order Problems):**
- CEOs mandate "do AI" without deep understanding, creating pressure without clear direction
- Middle managers (who must implement) are often skeptical and overwhelmed by use case volume
- ROI calculation remains unsolved—soft benefits hard to quantify, costs explode without guaranteed returns
- Revenue-generating use cases win funding over efficiency plays
- Security integration timing remains unresolved
- "14 months behind competitors" pressure drives FOMO-based decisions

**Build vs. Buy:**
- ~2/3 buy, ~1/3 build emerged as the consensus ratio
- Buy: table stakes tech, horizontal capabilities, no differentiated data
- Build: proprietary data, core mission capabilities, competitive advantage potential
- Data quality and integration matters more than model choice

**Organizational Impact:**
- Flattening organizations, fewer entry-level hires
- 10-year experience gap concern: who leads when current workforce retires?
- Remote work debate split along generational lines (50s+ demographic at dinner)
- AI-native generation (5-10 years out) will use AI fundamentally differently

**Development Practices:**
- Scrum declining for AI work
- Return to pair programming

**Technology Deployment:**
- Common use cases: sales, customer service, marketing, code generation
- 2-3 year outlook: patchwork deployment with AI-heavy pockets where ROI justifies it
- Power/electricity constraints limiting expansion

**Technical Challenges (Second-Order Problems):**
- Long-term memory and learning systems are major gaps
- Data formatting and integration (knowledge graphs, vector DBs, hybrids)
- Talent shortage—need software engineering skills more than data science
- Skills gap even when technology can deliver

**Other:**
- 2+ billion people lack internet access—digital divide growing
- Models mentioned: OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta/Llama (notably absent: Google)
- Workflows getting moderate preference over fully agentic approaches

### My Own Observations & Dot-Connecting

**Not from the conversation itself:**
- The workflows vs. agents distinction may be a false binary—agents can execute prescribed steps with proper instructions, making it more about development time vs. flexibility than capability
- Potential new hire value proposition: teaching existing workforce how to use AI differently (connecting the "AI-native generation uses AI differently" comment to the "what do new hires do" question)
- The uncertainty and rapid change makes the FOMO particularly problematic—shooting at a moving target while feeling you can't afford to stand still

**My key personal takeaway:**
First-order (human) problems dominate. There's a massive gap between the pressure to deploy AI, the capabilities of the technology, and organizations' ability to capture value. The companies that solve human problems—executive education, manager buy-in, ROI measurement, change management—will be the ones that actually leverage the technology. Second-order technical problems will get solved; first-order human problems will take much longer.

# AI Business Dinner - Comprehensive Discussion Notes

## Development Methodology Shift
- **Scrum is declining**: Moving away from scrum-based development
- **Return to pair programming**: Organizations reverting to pair programming approaches for AI development

## Business & Human Blockers (First-Order Problems)

### Executive Layer Challenges
- **Knowledge gap**: CEOs often lack AI understanding but mandate "just go do AI"
- **Training burden**: Executives need education on AI fundamentals and viable use case identification
- **Investment prioritization**: Revenue uplift use cases win over efficiency/cost savings
  - Example: Sales/customer service revenue generators prioritized over HR efficiency gains
- **ROI complexity**: Calculating return on investment remains extremely difficult due to multiple variables

### Middle Management Resistance
- **Ownership friction**: Managers who must build/implement solutions are often skeptical
- **Prioritization paralysis**: Overwhelmed by volume of potential use cases
- **Competitive pressure**: "Must do AI or be 14 months behind competitors"
- **FOMO-driven chaos**: Pressure to deploy AI vs. reality of what technology delivers

### Use Case Prioritization Crisis
- Intense pressure to deploy AI quickly
- Too many potential use cases to evaluate
- Difficulty prioritizing effectively
- Gap between CEO mandates and practical implementation
- Must balance "showing AI progress" with genuine business value

### Security Concerns
- **Timing debate**: When to address security?
  - During development phase?
  - At initial use case presentation?
- No consensus on proper security integration approach

## Build vs Buy Strategy

### General Consensus
- **Ratio**: ~2/3 buy, ~1/3 build

### Buy Criteria
- Table stakes technology
- Horizontal capabilities available from multiple vendors
- No competitive advantage from building in-house
- Lack of differentiated data

### Build Criteria
- Differentiated proprietary data
- Core mission-critical capabilities
- Competitive advantage potential
- Ability to execute better than external vendors

## Commonly Deployed Use Cases
1. **Sales** (revenue generating)
2. **Customer service** (revenue generating)
3. **Marketing** (revenue generating)
4. **Code generation/development tools**
5. HR (efficiency - lower priority)

## Data as the Differentiator

### Core Principle
- **Model choice matters less than data quality and integration**
- Competitive moat comes from data, not the model itself

### Data Requirements
- High quality
- Accessible
- Properly integrated into workflows
- Differentiated and proprietary

## Workflows vs Agentic AI

### Current Sentiment
- Moderate bullishness toward structured workflows
- Some skepticism of "true" agentic systems

### Key Insight: Potential False Binary
- Agents can follow prescribed steps with detailed instructions
- You can give agents: "Do step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4"
- Workflows provide reliability but require more development time
- Agents with proper tools and step-by-step guidance can execute workflows
- **Real difference**: Development time vs. flexibility, not capability

## ROI Calculation Challenges (Critical Problem)

### Specific Variables Making ROI Difficult

**Soft costs/benefits**:
- Reducing outage time - how to quantify value?
- Productivity improvements - assumption-based, hard to measure
- May not realize productivity gains even with tool deployment

**Hard costs**:
- Subscription sprawl: $20/month + $20/month + $10/month = $50/month per employee
- At 10,000 employees = $500,000/month = $6M/year
- Cost explosion without clear productivity return
- **Key problem**: Spending doesn't guarantee productivity benefit

### Framework Gap
- No clear ROI frameworks discussed
- Highly variable by use case
- Measurement remains problematic

## Organizational Impact

### Hiring & Workforce Evolution
- **Power/electricity constraints** limiting expansion
- **Organizational flattening**: Trend away from hiring entry-level college graduates
- **10-year experience gap**: If no new hires, who becomes experienced workforce when current employees retire?
- **Unresolved question**: What should new hires focus on?

### Remote Work Debate (Point of Disagreement)

**In-person advocates**:
- Culture building requires physical presence
- In-person learning is crucial
- Knowledge transfer needs face-to-face interaction

**Remote work advocates**:
- AI-native generation will work differently
- They'll work with agents regardless of location
- In-person bias is generational (50s+ demographic at dinner)
- Anecdote: Software engineering student son doesn't value in-person as much

**Key insight**: Dinner demographic was primarily 50s+, potentially biasing perspective

### AI-Native Generation (Emerging Insight)
- **Upcoming workforce** (5-10 years) will be completely AI-native
- They use AI in fundamentally different ways
- **Potential new hire value**: Teaching older workforce how to use AI differently and more effectively
- **Challenge**: Fuzzy ROI makes this investment hard to justify

## Technical Challenges (Second-Order Problems)

### Memory & Learning Systems
- Long-term learning and memory = significant technical gap
- Desire for customer-specific knowledge graphs
- Need for proper data formatting and integration

### Integration Approaches Needed
- Knowledge graphs
- Vector databases
- Hybrid approaches
- Emerging solutions

### Talent & Skills Gap
- Very few developers capable of building AI systems
- **Critical insight**: Building AI systems resembles traditional software engineering more than data science
- Skill gap is major blocker

## Timeline & Adoption Patterns

### 2-3 Year Outlook
- **Patchwork deployment**: AI will NOT be uniformly deployed across enterprises
- **Pocket-based implementation**: Heavy AI adoption in high-ROI areas only
- **ROI-gated deployment**: Areas where AI can't deliver sufficient ROI remain non-AI
- Result: Hybrid organizations with AI-heavy and AI-light departments
