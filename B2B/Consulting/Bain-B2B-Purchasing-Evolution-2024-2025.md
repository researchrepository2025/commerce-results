### Parsing How Winners Use AI
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/parsing-how-winners-use-ai-commercial-excellence-agenda-2025/

AI use cases vary by industry with no single "superior" application. Challenges include incomplete or low-quality data and poorly configured technology.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Using AI at scale has become table stakes for B2B companies. Growth prospects hinge in part on deploying technology to operate more efficiently and deliver better products and service to customers. Winners invest more in sales and marketing technologies and allocate greater resources as a proportion of overall sales and marketing budgets.

### How Sustainability Is Creating B2B Growth
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/how-sustainability-is-creating-b2b-growth-ceo-sustainability-guide-2025/
- **Publication Date**: September 2025
- **Authors**: Torsten Lichtenau, Yelena Ageyeva-Furman, Mattias C. Karlsson, Emily Kasavana, David Schottland, Jan Budde
- **Type**: Research Report - CEO Sustainability Guide
- **Key Findings**: By 2028, sustainability will become the second-most important purchasing criterion after quality, leapfrogging price and service levels. Half of B2B buyers already purchase more from sustainable suppliers, and nearly 70% plan to accelerate those purchases over the next three years. Over 80% of B2B buyers report paying a premium in their most recent purchase of a sustainable product. One in three is willing to pay more than 5% extra today, and more than 60% say they will be willing to pay that in three years.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Customers' sustainability priorities are shifting - reducing Scope 3 emissions is more important than suppliers previously understood. Buyers are increasingly focused on "sustainability of offers" (product/service sustainability) rather than just sustainability of supplier operations. Sellers must convey sustainability's true value to maintain or gain market share.

However, 85% of suppliers claim to embed sustainability in offerings while only 53% of customers feel sustainable options meet their needs. Only 35% of suppliers specifically target sustainability-conscious customers.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Industrial selling is changing - companies must learn to convey sustainability's true value to maintain or gain market share. Sellers should use data to prioritize sustainability-focused customers, construct clear sustainable value propositions, equip salesforces with sustainability knowledge and tools, and capture multiple sources of value beyond traditional pricing.

### Seven Reasons There's a B2B Buy-Sell Gap on Sustainability
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/seven-reasons-theres-a-b2b-buy-sell-gap-on-sustainability-infographic-ceo-sustainability-guide-2024/
- **Publication Date**: September 2024
- **Authors**: Torsten Lichtenau (Partner at Bain & Company), Jamie Cleghorn (Partner at Bain & Company)
- **Type**: Infographic/Research Report
- **Key Findings**: A survey of 500 companies revealed a growing "buy-sell gap" on sustainability. There is a widening chasm between buyers and sellers regarding sustainability expectations and practices. The research suggests a "new industrial sales model" is needed to bridge this gap in B2B sustainability approaches.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Sellers must develop new approaches to align their sustainability offerings with buyer expectations. The gap represents both a challenge and opportunity for differentiation.

### How Customers Are Using AI Search [2025 Research]
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/how-customers-are-using-ai-search/
- **Publication Date**: August 2025
- **Authors**: Richard Lichtenstein (Partner at Bain & Company)
- **Type**: Brief/Market Intelligence Research
- **Key Findings**: ChatGPT usage grew nearly 70% in first half of 2025. Shopping searches doubled, rising from 7.8% to 9.8% of total searches. Click-throughs on ChatGPT links tripled between March and June. Product categories gaining traction include personal tech, home improvement, and cosmetics and clothing. Users are increasingly using ChatGPT not just for recommendations but to find specific product links.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Brands need to optimize for "Artificial Intelligence Optimization (AIO)" or "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)". Investors should carefully evaluate companies reliant on traditional search models. The shift to AI search fundamentally changes how buyers discover vendors and products.

### Losing Control: How Zero-Click Search Affects B2B Marketers
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/losing-control-how-zero-click-search-affects-b2b-marketers-snap-chart/
- **Publication Date**: March 2025
- **Authors**: Natasha Sommerfeld, Zak Prauer
- **Type**: Snap Chart (brief analytical insight)
- **Key Findings**: Click-through rates have "plummeted" since Google introduced AI-generated search summaries. Zero-click searches are now the default, with click-through rates falling up to 30% in B2B categories. 85% of B2B buyers purchase from their initial "day one" vendor list. This trend reduces marketers' ability to influence buyer decisions through search strategies.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: AI-generated search summaries fundamentally change the marketing landscape. Being top-of-mind early in the buying process is crucial since most buyers purchase from their pre-search vendor list. Traditional search engine optimization strategies must evolve.

### Goodbye Clicks, Hello AI: Zero-Click Search Redefines Marketing
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/goodbye-clicks-hello-ai-zero-click-search-redefines-marketing/
- **Publication Date**: February 2025
- **Authors**: Natasha Sommerfeld (Partner, Boston), Megan McCurry (Partner, Chicago), Doug Harrington (Director, Specialist Marketing, Minneapolis)
- **Type**: Brief/Research Insight
- **Key Findings**: About 80% of consumers rely on "zero-click" search results in at least 40% of searches. Organic web traffic is estimated to be reduced by 15-25%. Approximately 60% of searches now end without users clicking through to another website. Large language model (LLM) search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity are gaining popularity. Customers use LLMs for research and information summarization (68%), news and weather updates (48%), and shopping recommendations (42%).
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Marketers must adapt by optimizing for AI crawlability, diversifying content formats, and redefining success metrics beyond click-throughs. Traditional website traffic as a primary metric is becoming less relevant.

### Marketing's New Middleman: AI Agents
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/marketings-new-middleman-ai-agents/
- **Publication Date**: April 2025
- **Authors**: Natasha Sommerfeld (Partner, Boston), Rishi Dave (Partner, New York), Daniel Webster-Clark (Associate Partner, Chicago)
- **Type**: Brief/Insights Article
- **Key Findings**: AI agents are becoming "middlemen" in the marketing funnel, fundamentally changing how consumers discover and research products. 80% of consumers rely on "zero-click" AI search results for at least 40% of searches. Company website traffic has decreased up to 30%. AI referral traffic growing ~40% monthly. AI-powered search traffic to retailer sites increased 1,200% between July 2024-February 2025.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: To succeed in the era of LLMs, marketers must optimize for AI agents—not just humans. AI agents are disrupting traditional purchasing journeys by compressing discovery-to-decision processes, providing personalized recommendations, and reducing opportunities for brands to directly influence consumers. Marketers must develop "agent-friendly" content structures and focus on third-party validation and expert commentary.

### AI Is Transforming Productivity, but Sales Remains a New Frontier
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/ai-transforming-productivity-sales-remains-new-frontier-technology-report-2025/
- **Publication Date**: September 23, 2025
- **Authors**: Ann Bosche, Jue Wang, Peter Bowen, Tamara Lewis, Justin Murphy, Mark Kovac
- **Type**: Technology Report - AI in Sales
- **Key Findings**: Sellers currently spend only about 25% of time actually selling to customers. AI could "double selling time by taking on work that doesn't add much value." Potential for "more than a 30% increase in win rates." 25 potential AI use cases identified across sales lifecycle. Most companies haven't unlocked AI benefits at scale. Success requires clean data and reimagining sales processes.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Sales teams should focus on high-impact process slices, prioritize data cleanup, secure C-level sponsorship, and use rapid proof-of-concept testing. Adopt end-to-end process view rather than point solutions. While AI's sales potential is significant, most companies are still in early stages of meaningful implementation.

### How Digital Natives Are Changing B2B Purchasing
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/how-digital-natives-are-changing-b2b-purchasing-hbr/
- **Publication Date**: March 2018 (Note: This article predates the 2024-2025 timeframe but remains foundational to current research)
- **Authors**: Eric Almquist (Former Advisory Partner at Bain & Company)
- **Type**: Harvard Business Review insights article
- **Key Findings**: Digital natives (20-35 year olds) are transforming B2B purchasing - 73% are involved in purchase decision-making and about half of B2B product researchers are digital natives. Over 70% of searches start with generic terms. Buyers rely more on online search, websites, peers, and social media. Salespeople are contacted later in the process, sometimes not at all. Digital natives prefer short, visual information bursts and online research over direct sales interactions. They prefer companies with strong environmental and social responsibility.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Vendors must curate online content deliberately, provide comprehensive website information, deliver value through trust and connectedness, and demonstrate social and environmental commitment. Digital natives have brought their consumer habits to the B2B world.

### The B2B Elements of Value
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/the-b2b-elements-of-value-hbr/
- **Publication Date**: February 2018 (Note: This article predates the 2024-2025 timeframe but remains foundational to current research)
- **Authors**: Eric Almquist, Jamie Cleghorn, Lori Sherer
- **Type**: Harvard Business Review research article
- **Key Findings**: B2B purchasing decisions are driven by more than just rational, quantifiable criteria. Researchers identified 40 "elements of value" across five categories: table stakes, functional, ease of doing business, individual, and inspirational. "Subjective, sometimes quite personal concerns" play a significant role in B2B purchasing, beyond traditional metrics like price and performance. Considerations such as whether a product can enhance the buyer's reputation or reduce anxiety are increasingly important in business purchasing decisions.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: As B2B offerings become more commoditized, understanding the full range of both rational and emotional factors behind business purchases is critical to avoiding the commodity trap. The framework helps identify what matters most to each set of stakeholders and how companies can stand out from competitors.

### What B2Bs Need to Know About Their Buyers
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/what-b2bs-need-to-know-about-their-buyers-hbr/
- **Publication Date**: September 2022
- **Authors**: Saber Sherrard (Partner, Dallas), Rishi Dave (Partner, New York), Mollie Parker MacGregor (Associate Partner, Dallas)
- **Type**: Harvard Business Review insights article
- **Key Findings**: B2B sales success depends on more than just traditional selling techniques. Preparation and understanding buyer needs are critical. Case study examples show how poor product demonstration can lose contracts, specifically due to inadequate sales staff preparation, clunky user interfaces, weak product roadmaps, and misalignment with buyer requirements.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Companies must deeply understand their buyers' expectations and meticulously prepare for sales interactions to be competitive. Every customer touchpoint must be optimized to meet buyer expectations.

### B2B Marketers: All the Right Moves in All the Wrong Places
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/b2b-marketers-all-the-right-moves-in-all-the-wrong-places/
- **Publication Date**: September 2020
- **Authors**: Saber Sherrard (Partner), Johnny Hanson (Partner), Jerrod Vaughan (Associate Partner)
- **Type**: Research Brief
- **Key Findings**: Buyers overwhelmingly trust information from their professional community (peers, current customers/vendors, junior colleagues, industry sources) significantly more than advertisements, sales representatives, webinars, or vendor websites. Over 50% of buyers said manager-level colleagues significantly influence technology purchases, up to 80% influence for director-level staff. During COVID-19, 60%+ of buyers continued making technology purchases while 90% educated themselves for future purchases. Marketers consistently underestimate the importance of professional community conversations and overestimate their own ability to direct purchasing decisions.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: The goal for B2B marketers is "to become a credible source and orchestrator in the broader ecosystem in which buyers increasingly discover, vet and choose their vendors." Successful marketers differentiate by understanding buyer preferences, creating community conversation spaces, disseminating insights through professional networks, and providing training and certification opportunities. What people say about you matters more than what you tell them.

### Why Software Companies' Customer Success Is Failing
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/why-software-companies-customer-success-is-failing-tech-report-2024/
- **Publication Date**: September 2024
- **Authors**: Matt Eldridge (Partner, New York), Greg Fiore (Partner, San Francisco), Simon Heap (Advisory Partner, Silicon Valley), Kenzie Haygood (Associate Partner, San Francisco)
- **Type**: Technology Report - Software Customer Success Research
- **Key Findings**: Buyers ranked "assistance with technical implementation or deployment" as their highest priority for customer success, while vendors ranked it sixth. Nearly two-thirds of software customers feel their post-sales needs are only being moderately addressed or worse. Customers prefer a technical role as their primary customer success contact, but vendors often assign non-technical customer success managers. Net revenue retention (NRR) rates decreased for 75% of software companies despite increased customer success spending.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: There is a significant misalignment between how software vendors provide post-sales support and what customers actually value in their software engagement. Software companies must realign customer success priorities to match buyer expectations, particularly around technical implementation support.

### Will Agentic AI Disrupt SaaS?
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/will-agentic-ai-disrupt-saas-technology-report-2025/
- **Publication Date**: September 23, 2025
- **Authors**: David Crawford, Chris McLaughlin, Purna Doddapaneni, Greg Fiore
- **Type**: Technology Report - AI and SaaS
- **Key Findings**: AI is disrupting SaaS by automating tasks and workflows across four strategic scenarios: AI enhances SaaS (low automation, low penetration), spending compresses (low automation, high penetration), AI outshines SaaS (high automation, low penetration), and AI cannibalizes SaaS (high automation, high penetration). Critical strategic priorities include making AI central to roadmap, turning unique data into competitive edge, rethinking pricing from seat-based to outcome-based, and building AI fluency across the business.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: "Disruption is mandatory, but obsolescence is optional." SaaS companies must proactively integrate AI, leverage proprietary data, and reimagine their value proposition to remain competitive. Traditional SaaS business models are under threat from AI-powered alternatives.

### Deals Rise in 2025, But Easy Wins May Be Over
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/insights/deals-rise-in-2025-but-easy-wins-may-be-over-technology-report-2025/
- **Publication Date**: September 23, 2025
- **Authors**: David Lipman, Christopher Perry, Jennifer Smith, Jonny Holliday
- **Type**: Technology Market Analysis Report
- **Key Findings**: Traditional revenue growth strategies are becoming less effective. Software penetration is "topping out in major sectors like retail and manufacturing." Buyers are seeking more targeted, value-driven solutions. Customers want "outcome- or value-based pricing models." Increasing interest in software with integrated payments capabilities and growing demand for AI-enabled product innovations. "Easy money" era of software investing is ending.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Future returns will depend on finding new revenue sources, improving operational efficiency, developing targeted go-to-market strategies, and leveraging AI for product development. Companies must focus on "displacing competitors" rather than expanding into new markets. Successful firms will invest in "go-to-market capabilities" and market segmentation. Traditional upsell/cross-sell motions are less effective and like-for-like pricing increases are harder to sustain amid pressure on customer budgets and heavy competition.

- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Winning suppliers are taking advantage of the shift towards digital and self-service B2B purchasing channels. The right e-commerce strategy doesn't replace your salesforce—it empowers it, allowing sales reps to focus on high-value customer interactions and new business development while your platform optimizes every facet of routine sales.

### CEOs' Prioritization of Sustainability Has Declined Sharply as AI and Inflation Sit Atop Their Agendas
- **URL**: https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2024/ceos-prioritization-of-sustainability-has-declined-sharply-as-ai-and-inflation-now-sit-atop-their-agendas-consumers-b2b-buyers-remain-deeply-concerned/
- **Publication Date**: 2024
- **Authors**: Press release from Bain & Company
- **Type**: Press Release
- **Key Findings**: While CEOs have deprioritized sustainability in favor of AI and inflation concerns, B2B buyers remain deeply concerned about sustainability. This creates a gap between executive priorities and buyer purchasing criteria. Buyers continue to prioritize sustainability as a top-three purchasing criterion despite CEO attention shifting elsewhere.
- **Impact to B2B Sellers**: Sales and marketing teams must bridge the gap between executive priorities and buyer expectations. Even as internal focus shifts, customer-facing teams must maintain strong sustainability credentials and messaging to align with buyer priorities.

## Themes and Insights

### 1. AI Transformation of B2B Purchasing and Selling

The most dominant theme across Bain's 2024-2025 research is the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on both B2B purchasing behavior and sales effectiveness:

- Managing pricing pressures
- Modernizing and adopting go-to-market technologies
- Integrating sales plays into technology stack (70% struggle with this)

### 5. Software and SaaS Buyer Evolution

B2B software purchasing has distinct characteristics and challenges:

**Buyer Priorities:**
- Technical implementation/deployment assistance ranked as highest priority
- Customers prefer technical role as primary contact vs. non-technical CSM
- Nearly two-thirds feel post-sales needs only moderately addressed or worse
- Traditional upsell/cross-sell motions becoming less effective
- Like-for-like pricing increases harder to sustain

**Market Dynamics:**
- Software penetration topping out in major sectors (retail, manufacturing)
- Demand shifting toward outcome- or value-based pricing models
- Interest in software with integrated payments capabilities
- Growing demand for AI-enabled product innovations
- "Easy money" era of software investing is ending

**Agentic AI Disruption:**
- AI disrupting SaaS through task/workflow automation
- Four scenarios: AI enhances SaaS, spending compresses, AI outshines SaaS, AI cannibalizes SaaS
- Must make AI central to roadmap and turn unique data into competitive edge
- Need to rethink pricing from seat-based to outcome-based
- "Disruption is mandatory, but obsolescence is optional"

### 6. Pricing and Value Communication

Pricing strategy has become more sophisticated and technology-enabled:

**Current Approaches:**
- 55% of companies matched or exceeded input cost increases with price increases
- Winners increasingly use technology enabling dynamic pricing
- Surgical approach through customer segmentation
- Companies confident in pricing expect 3 percentage point margin premium
- Margin gap between confident and less confident firms: 5-11 percentage points

**Barriers and Challenges:**
- 67% cite competitive pressures as main barrier
- 39% lack sufficient data analytics for pricing decisions
- 37% have gaps in team pricing expertise
- Need to articulate unique value propositions to justify pricing

**Value Framework:**
- 40 elements of value across five categories: table stakes, functional, ease of doing business, individual, inspirational
- Subjective and personal concerns increasingly important
- Considerations like reputation enhancement and anxiety reduction matter
- As offerings commoditize, emotional factors play larger role
- Understanding full range of rational and emotional factors critical

### 7. Technology Integration and Adoption Gaps

Despite high technology investment, execution challenges persist:

**Integration Challenges:**
- 80% claim to run structured, repeatable sales/marketing activities
- 70% don't effectively integrate sales plays into technology
- Only 20% have realized full value from technology integration
- Achieving predictable growth through sales plays requires following six best practices
- Hardest best practice: integrating system into revenue technology stack

**Investment Patterns:**
- Nearly all firms investing in AI for pricing intelligence
- 52% plan frontline training to articulate value propositions
- Winners allocate more resources to sales/marketing technologies (absolute and proportional)
- Winners dedicate more budget to keeping foundations up to date
- Focus on AI/automation, coaching, segmentation, marketing optimization

**Data and Capability Gaps:**
- Incomplete or low-quality data cited as major challenge
- Poorly configured technology limits AI effectiveness
- Need for clean data and reimagined sales processes
- C-level sponsorship critical for success
- Rapid proof-of-concept testing recommended approach

## Cross-Publication Synthesis

### The Emerging B2B Buyer Profile (2024-2025)

Based on Bain's comprehensive research, the modern B2B buyer exhibits these characteristics:

1. **Digital-first researcher** who conducts extensive online research before engaging sales
2. **Community-reliant** decision-maker who trusts peers over vendor marketing
3. **Sustainability-conscious** purchaser willing to pay premiums for sustainable offerings
4. **AI-assisted** researcher using ChatGPT and other LLMs for discovery and evaluation
5. **Outcome-focused** buyer demanding value-based vs. seat-based pricing
6. **Technically-oriented** evaluator prioritizing implementation support over traditional customer success
7. **Day-one loyal** purchaser (85%) who rarely considers vendors outside initial consideration set

### Critical Success Factors for B2B Sellers

To succeed with evolved B2B buyers, sellers must:

1. **Scale AI deployment** across sales, pricing, and productivity (4.5+ use cases)
2. **Integrate technology effectively** - close the 70% gap in sales play/CRM integration
3. **Build sustainability credentials** - will be #2 criterion by 2028
4. **Optimize for AI discovery** - GEO/AIO replacing traditional SEO
5. **Enable professional community** - facilitate peer-to-peer conversations
6. **Implement dynamic pricing** - use data and segmentation for surgical pricing
7. **Develop sales play systems** - achieve 2.2x growth advantage
8. **Realign customer success** - prioritize technical implementation support
9. **Focus on day-one awareness** - 85% buy from initial consideration set
10. **Transform value propositions** - address rational and emotional elements

### The Growth Imperative

Bain's research reveals a widening gap between winners and laggards:
- **Winners**: 2x industry average revenue and margin growth
- **Key differentiator**: AI scale, sales play execution, dynamic pricing, long-term productivity investment
- **2025 outlook**: Winners confident of maintaining 2x advantage
- **Stakes**: Companies not scaling AI and integrating technology risk falling permanently behind

The research makes clear that incremental improvements are insufficient. B2B companies must fundamentally transform their approach to buyer engagement, technology deployment, and value delivery to compete in the AI-enabled, sustainability-focused, digitally-native purchasing environment of 2024-2025 and beyond.
