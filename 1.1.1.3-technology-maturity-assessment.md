The technology maturity assessment reveals that agentic commerce is transitioning from experimental to production phases across multiple use cases, with significant variation in readiness levels. Shopping assistants and dynamic pricing have achieved production scale, while autonomous purchasing and B2B procurement remain in pilot phases requiring further development.

Success factors include focusing on specific problem domains, ensuring reliable performance, building user trust through transparency, and maintaining clear value propositions. Failures in 2024, particularly in hardware AI assistants, demonstrate the importance of solving genuine user problems rather than creating solutions in search of problems.

The market opportunity is substantial, with multiple billion-dollar markets emerging, but success requires sustained investment, technical excellence, and careful attention to user needs and regulatory requirements. Organizations entering this space should focus on proven use cases with clear business value while building capabilities for future expansion as the technology matures.

**Evidence Quality Assessment**: This analysis is based primarily on Tier 1 and Tier 2 evidence sources, including technical documentation from major vendors, academic research, and verified performance metrics. Where specific metrics were unavailable, this has been explicitly noted rather than estimated.

**Confidence Level**: High confidence in maturity assessments for shopping assistants and dynamic pricing (extensive public data), medium confidence for autonomous purchasing and B2B procurement (limited public metrics), and medium confidence for service booking (geographic limitations in data availability).
