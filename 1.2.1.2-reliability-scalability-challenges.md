## Conclusion

The investigation reveals significant reliability and scalability challenges in agentic commerce systems, with documented evidence of major infrastructure failures, quality degradation issues, and architectural limitations. While technical achievements in scaling (such as Amazon's 80,000+ chip deployment) demonstrate progress, fundamental reliability issues persist with 70% error rates and 40% project cancellation predictions indicating systemic challenges requiring architectural solutions rather than incremental improvements.

The evidence strongly suggests that current agentic commerce infrastructure is not ready for mission-critical commercial deployment without substantial reliability engineering investments and architectural redesign to address cascade failure vulnerabilities, data integrity risks, and quality assurance gaps.
