# Deep Research Report: Key Players and Strategic Analysis in Agentic Commerce

*Research completed: January 2025*

## Executive Summary

The agentic commerce ecosystem is experiencing explosive growth, with the global total addressable market (TAM) projected to reach [$136 billion by 2025 and $1.7 trillion by 2030](https://www.edgardunn.com/articles/agentic-commerce-the-future-of-payments), reflecting a CAGR of 67%. The market is being driven by major technology providers building foundational infrastructure while startups create innovative applications across commerce, customer service, and enterprise workflows.

## Market Definition and Scope

Agentic commerce refers to autonomous AI agents that can independently perform commercial activities on behalf of users, including product discovery, price comparison, transaction execution, and post-purchase management. These agents operate with varying degrees of autonomy and can make purchasing decisions, negotiate terms, manage subscriptions, and handle complex multi-step commerce workflows without continuous human intervention.
