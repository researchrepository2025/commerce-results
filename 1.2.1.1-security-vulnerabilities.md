## Conclusion

The evidence demonstrates that agentic commerce systems face unprecedented security challenges that traditional cybersecurity approaches cannot fully address. With 25+ documented vulnerabilities, including 6 critical-severity flaws and 15+ confirmed real-world exploitation incidents, the threat landscape is both active and evolving rapidly.

The discovery of universal bypass techniques like "Policy Puppetry" and zero-click vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-32711 indicates that fundamental security problems in AI systems remain unsolved. Organizations deploying agentic commerce systems must implement comprehensive security strategies that address both traditional and AI-specific threats while preparing for an evolving regulatory landscape.

The research confirms that while effective mitigations exist for specific attack vectors, **no foolproof defense against AI system manipulation has been developed**. This reality requires organizations to adopt defense-in-depth strategies, continuous monitoring, and rapid incident response capabilities specifically designed for AI system security.
